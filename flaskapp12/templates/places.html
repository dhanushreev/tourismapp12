			 	<p>Karnataka is a tapestry of colours, cultures, flavours, landscapes, timelessness and heart stopping beauty. 
                 It’s a place where vibrant worlds seamlessly meld into one another every few hundred Sedate plains suddenly rise to dizzying mist covered hilly heights, and then plunge withcareless abandon in a white-watered freefall to become languid rivers that flow past citieswhere time has stopped altogether. 
                 from sandy beaches in the coastal east to the wild mountains and thriving farmlands deep in the interior.
                 Home to nearly 9 million people, the city of Bangalore makes a great starting point of a Karnataka tour,packed with temples, churches, shopping malls.
